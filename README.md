# DebApMyPHP_5.2 (for Vagrant) #

*aka "Debian Squeeze Apache MySQL PHP 5.2 in a box" / "I-hate-having-comp-issue-with-olde-PHP-product"*

It's just a plain siple Vagrant pack including a Box, in his own branch for diskspace concerns, and a set of Puppet Manifests/Modules used to pre-configure your VM.

So, if you didn't get it in the first sentence, you'll have to checkout the whole repos in order to have the Box + Manifests.
